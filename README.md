# > 🎯 Learning Python in 4 weeks by cementing missing parts (Hard mode).

## Overview ✨

This project tracks our progress in learning Python as a group over 4 weeks. We have set weekly goals and use GitHub to store our work and track contributions.
Although this sprint has high pressure in its execution, the goal is self-learning and you are allowed to mold it to your liking and schedule(s).

## Goals 🎳

- Week 1: **( Python 1 - Basics )** Complete lessons 1-16 and exercises (if you want to )
- Week 2: **( Python 2: Getting More out of Python  )** Complete lessons 1-13 and exercises (if you want to ) 
- Week 3: **( Python 3: The Python Environment )** Complete lessons 1-13 and exercises (if you want to ) 
- Week 4: **( Python 4: Advanced Python )** Complete lessons 1-16 and exercises (if you want to )

## Parallel goal 🎿
  _(please note: Im not affiliated with Cisco `21-jun-2023` )_ 
- Week 1-4 Cisco PCAP course  [PCAP: Programming Essentials in Python](https://www.netacad.com/courses/programming/pcap-programming-essentials-python)

## Files ✨

- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies 
- `week1`: Code and exercises from Week 1
   - lesson-1/`hello_world.py`: Code from Lesson 1  
   - lesson-1/solutions/`hie_mom.py`: Solutions to Exercises 1
- `week2`: Code and exercises from Week 2


## Instructions ✨

1. Fork this repository 
2. Add your code and exercises to the appropriate week folder (in 4 Easy 👍 steps, making sure to `🚨🚨🚨 USE lowercase characters & hyphens'-' or underscores'_' on spaces ON folder names, the GitHub way ✅) 
   
   - 🌱 **STEP 1:** enter the respective **week** folder you're currently in, _e.g week 1 for beginners._  
   - 🌱 **STEP 2:** Create a folder with your GitHub-username **initial** as the folder name(first character, e.g `'a'` if the username is 'Ajaay')
   - 🌱 **STEP 3:** Create a folder with your GitHub **username** as the folder name ( e.g `'ajaay'` if the username is 'Ajaay')
   - 🌱 **STEP 4:** Create the folder **lesson** folder e.g `'lesson-1'` for the content related to lesson-1 (chapter 1)
   - 
   - 🌿 **BONUS TIP:** You can add your own folders, exercise folders or modules inside that lesson's folder to have a good folder structure and also maintain best practices (see below: ⏩🥋 )
   - 
   - 🌳 **COMPLETE EXAMPLE:** `Week1` / `a` (github-name-initial) / `aajay` (username) /  `lesson-1` (lesson folder) / `hello_world.py` (python filename)
